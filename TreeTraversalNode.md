# Breadth- first Search

Visiting all nodes on the same level 
traversing from left to right from top to bottom

* Implementation
Create a queue (First in First out) push and shift 
and a visited array 


# Depth First Seach PreOrder 

top to bottom left to right 


# Depth First Search PostOrder 

bottom to top left to right 
The parent node's childs nodes are visited before the parent node

# Depth First Search InOrder 

We traverse the entire left side first and then the rightnside
the nodes are traversed in order from smallest to largest
